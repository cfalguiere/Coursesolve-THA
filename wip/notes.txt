Topic Models
Topic models work by discovering patterns of word use and connecting documents that exhibit similar patterns. 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) -> topic to profile

Latent semantic indexing 

trending topic

In text-based classification
method, we construct word vectors with trending topic defi-
nition and tweets, and the commonly used tf-idf weights are
used to classify the topics using a Naive Bayes Multinomial
classifier.

In network-based classification method, we identify
top 5 similar topics for a given topic based on the number of
common influential users. 

The categories of the similar topics
and the number of common influential users between the given
topic and its similar topics are used to classify the given topic
using a C5.0 decision tree learner.
